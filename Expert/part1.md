# Basics beginning

No predictions first turn, with some exceptions
- Unless very clear disadvantage
Try to setup first turn
- harzard
- lightshiled
- sleep
If i can setup first turn: Do this, otherwise get out
Neutral stance (flying / normal): Stay in, setup if i can, otherwise attack.
But if super effective: rather setup further

Switch if enemy very clear advantage, or hazards

Midgame 2 pokemon fainted:
- Unkown: Play safe: Setup or scout.
Scount: Find a really hight defense pokemon, switch into that
If we are set up: Don't switch out (unless clear advantage)

Lots of information against the enemy:
- Play as safe

# Setup
6 Stages icrease: (1.5, 2, 2.5, 3): decrease(.67, .5)
-> Always switch out if decreased twice unless really big advantage
Usually just boost to 1.5
- Shellshmesh: USE IT
Usually: Don't use speed up, usually not in moveset anyway
Setup also includes weather (usually not in the moves)

# Priority
Priority moves will always move first. There are tiers

Don't dynamax to early

Hyper offensive team: Predict a lot

# Dynamaxing (Gigantomax: figure that out)
- If setup and good advantage (like legendary), time to destroy (clear advantage / setup)
- If opponent is dynamaxing (and i'm not), if i can counter it don't dynamax. If i can't counter: use good-enough pokemon, use max-protect for one turn, then attack
- Players usually don't dynamax until their last pokemon.
- Dynamax can setup to sweep. 

# Moves decresing stats:
Use them once, then switch out
Moves that damage myself: Rockhead and stuff negates that
- Usually rather not hit yourself. Most pokemon with recoil have stuff to prevent them from getting damaged.
- First iteration: Only hit myself if full hp, later: maybe check if i won't hit myself

# Healing moves
Rest: Either have chesto berry / sweet talk.
Always use rest when below certain hp. ALWAYS 2 turns of sleep, then: wake up 
- Rest below 50% health, unless chesto berry is gone, then don't rest.

# STATS
Always max speed unless gyroball or trickroom, 0 IV and 0 SPEED
31 IV and 84 EV in other stats. Neutral nature.
Hinting: Enemy outspeeding / not outspeeding can give a hint on build

Stats are reset upon switching

# Other stuff to take into account
## Prankster
Gives priority to non attacking move.
- Outspeed most moves (like thunderwave)

# Team
Team usually contains a mon that can setup a hazard

# Hazards
- Stealth rock: look it up!
- Spikes
- Toxic spikes (faster Pokemon takes toxic damage first) switch: Reset to 6% (6, 12, 18, 24,...)
