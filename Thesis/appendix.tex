  health while the opposing \textit{Kommo-o} has 33\% of his health remaining. Below the game window, all possible actions
  for the player is displayed. A log of previous actions is displayed on the right-hand side.}

	to properly represent different game objects. The network has two outputs: a probability distribution over actions to take, 
	and an estimate of player strength in the current state.}
