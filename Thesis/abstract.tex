\chapter*{Abstract}
Pokémon is the highest-grossing video game franchise and revolves around collecting Pokémon with the 
ultimate goal of becoming \grqq the very best, like no one ever was\grqq. This thesis provides a detailed
introduction to competitive Pokémon battles and summarizes previous research on the topic. Current
search-based agents lack proper long term planning as the large quantity of possible states limits
the amount of turns that can be looked ahead. A combination of existing \textit{MiniMax}-
and \textit{Rule Based}-Agents that allows for planning and execution of a match plan is introduced.
After playing over 1,400 battles on the \textit{Pokémon Showdown} ranked ladder against human players,
the bot achieved a mean Elo of $1,227$ and a maximum of $1,432$. While the agent only won 273 out of 
1,000 games against the best open source implementation, analysis of battles lead to the conclusion that defeats
are often caused by lack of features that due to time restrictions were not fully implemented. 
Additionally, the initial state of over 70,000 games was rated and then played out by two baseline 
agents. Results showed that both a random agent and an agent that prioritizes the most damaging
move have a lower win rate on unfavorable board ratings while winning more games on a positive rating.
