This is a game of turn-based team battle, where the objective is to defeat an opponent team using clever combinations of creatures and their abilities. The gameplay is reminiscent of computer role-playing game battles and collectible card games. The game has characteristics, such as the combination of turnbased gameplay and partial observability, that are unusual in current game-based AI competitions and therefore offers a fresh challenge.}, booktitle={2017 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)}, publisher={IEEE}, author={Lee, Scott and Togelius, Julian}, year={2017}, month={Aug}, pages={191–198} }
