  This is a game of turn-based team battle, where the objective is

   game battles and collectible card games. The game has characteristics, 
   such as the combination of turnbased gameplay and partial observability, 
   that are unusual in current game-based AI competitions and therefore offers 
   a fresh challenge.},

  long-lived competitive scene that has evolved throughout the last two decades. 
  The game exhibits several properties that come together to present a worthy 
  challenge for AI agents to tackle. In this work, we present a low-cost selfplay 
  based reinforcement learning approach to the competitive battling aspect of the game. 
  The proposed agent was tested and trained in a variety of environments designed to 
  simulate possible use cases of such an AI. Experiments demonstrate that the agent is 
  capable of performing on par with the state of the art in search-based Pokémon AI, as 
  well as being competitive with human players on a popular matchmaking ladder. Furthermore, 
  we investigate the transferability of trained skill-whether an agent trained in one
   environment performs well in a different environment.},

@article{Konda_Tsitsiklis, title={Actor-Critic Algorithms}, abstractNote={We propose and analyze a class of actor-critic algorithms for simulation-based optimization of a Markov decision process over a parameterized family of randomized stationary policies. These are two-time-scale algorithms in which the critic uses TD learning with a linear approximation architecture and the actor is updated in an approximate gradient direction based on information provided by the critic. We show that the features for the critic should span a subspace prescribed by the choice of parameterization of the actor. We conclude by discussing convergence properties and some open problems.}, author={Konda, Vijay R and Tsitsiklis, John N}, pages={7} }

@article{Pandurangan_Mustoori_Badra_Deshmukh_Pachauri_Li_Chen_Ravikumar, title={PokéBot: Agent for Pokémon Showdown}, abstractNote={Pokémon is a cross-generation game that is centered around creating one's team of six Pokémon and becoming the very best with them. Pokémon Showdown, a Pokémon battling simulator, is the platform that makes it easier for players to theory craft, fight a variety of opponents, and try different battling strategies. In this paper, an approach to optimize a player's decisions is explored in the Single Battle ruleset. Reinforcement Learning is explored in the form of a Deep Q Neural Network (DQN), State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) Algorithm, and Cross Entropy Method (CEM) Agents with the DQN Agent performing best. These agents are trained and tested using different Poke´mon teams. The core mechanics of the game, the methods of acquiring data, as well as training and testing are discussed to achieve optimal win ratios for the agent. Additionally, a winning percentage predictor is discussed in terms of the model and the method that works best to evaluate the strength of both players at every turn in the game.}, author={Pandurangan, Abhilash and Mustoori, Aishwarya and Badra, Joseph and Deshmukh, Mrunal and Pachauri, Nilay and Li, Ruicheng and Chen, Ruoyu and Ravikumar, Tarun}, pages={8} }
