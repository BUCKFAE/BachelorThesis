  competition built around a clone of the popular game Pokemon. 
  This is a game of turn-based team battle, where the objective is 
  to defeat an opponent team using clever combinations of creatures 
  and their abilities. The gameplay is reminiscent of computer role-playing
   game battles and collectible card games. The game has characteristics, 
   such as the combination of turnbased gameplay and partial observability, 
   that are unusual in current game-based AI competitions and therefore offers 
   a fresh challenge.},

  abstractNote={Pokémon is a popular role-playing video game franchise with a 
  long-lived competitive scene that has evolved throughout the last two decades. 
  The game exhibits several properties that come together to present a worthy 
  challenge for AI agents to tackle. In this work, we present a low-cost selfplay 
  based reinforcement learning approach to the competitive battling aspect of the game. 
  The proposed agent was tested and trained in a variety of environments designed to 
  simulate possible use cases of such an AI. Experiments demonstrate that the agent is 
  capable of performing on par with the state of the art in search-based Pokémon AI, as 
  well as being competitive with human players on a popular matchmaking ladder. Furthermore, 
  we investigate the transferability of trained skill-whether an agent trained in one
   environment performs well in a different environment.},

@article{Konda_Tsitsiklis, title={Actor-Critic Algorithms}, abstractNote={We propose and analyze a class of actor-critic algorithms for simulation-based optimization of a Markov decision process over a parameterized family of randomized stationary policies. These are two-time-scale algorithms in which the critic uses TD learning with a linear approximation architecture and the actor is updated in an approximate gradient direction based on information provided by the critic. We show that the features for the critic should span a subspace prescribed by the choice of parameterization of the actor. We conclude by discussing convergence properties and some open problems.}, author={Konda, Vijay R and Tsitsiklis, John N}, pages={7} }
